# Brahma_Analysis
Code created for analysis of the [Brahma simulations](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4311/7689209?login=true) which are presented in the paper "Signatures of BH seeding on the M• − σ relation: Predictions from the BRAHMA simulations" ([link to arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17476)), which has been submitted to ApJ. 

This code is built off of the arepo_package repository: https://github.com/akbhowmi/arepo_package/tree/master

For a worked example of our kinematic decomposition of BRAHMA (and TNG) subhalos, see Kinematic_Decomp_clean.ipynb. For the generation of all the figures in my paper, see Paper_Figs_clean.ipynb. The rest of the .py files contain functions used to produce the data which has been plotted in Paper_Figs_clean.ipynb.

As the simulation data is too large to be contained here, please contact me if you wish to see the original data: yja6qa@virginia.edu
