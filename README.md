# Brahma_Analysis
Code created for analysis of the [Brahma simulations](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4311/7689209?login=true) which are presented in the paper "Signatures of BH seeding on the M• − σ relation: Predictions from the BRAHMA simulations" ([link to arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17476)), which has been submitted to ApJ. 

This code is built off of the arepo_package repository: https://github.com/akbhowmi/arepo_package/tree/master

As the simulation data is too large to be contained here, please contact me if you wish to see the original data: yja6qa@virginia.edu
